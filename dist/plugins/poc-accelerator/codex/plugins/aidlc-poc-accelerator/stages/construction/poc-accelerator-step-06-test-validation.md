# PoC Test Validation

MANDATORY: Follow stage-protocol.md for approval gates, question format, and completion messages.

## Steps

### Step 1: Plan Requirement-Level Tests

Load the quality persona and map each acceptance criterion to the smallest
meaningful unit or integration test. Include the safe demo path, a key invalid
input, and the redaction behavior; the invalid-input case must show the error
response is specific and leaks no internals (ARNs, account IDs, stack traces).
For LLM-driven behavior, do not exact-match unit-test the model: build a small
eval set (15–30 representative cases from the acceptance criteria and any
customer-calibrated examples), pick a grader per case type, and assert on
aggregate accuracy against a stated threshold — per the LLM evaluation
knowledge. The deterministic code around the LLM call (prompt
assembly, parsing, guardrails) still gets normal tests. The eval set is a
handoff deliverable: it is what makes a later model or prompt swap safely
evaluable. State explicitly which production test types
are out of scope for this PoC.

### Step 2: Execute Repeatable Checks

Run the project build, unit tests, and focused integration/smoke checks against
the deployed non-production environment when available. Use read-only AWS API
MCP server calls to confirm the deployed resource states the integration checks
depend on. Do not call customer production systems or use unapproved real data.

### Step 3: Write Evidence

Create `poc-accelerator-test-plan.md` and
`poc-accelerator-test-results.md` with commands, timestamps, criterion mapping,
pass/fail results, defects, and rerun instructions. A failure stays visible;
create a bounded remediation item instead of silently excluding it.

### Step 4: Update State

This is an automatic validation checkpoint. Mark
`poc-accelerator-step-06-test-validation` complete in `<record>/aidlc-state.md` once
results and any known failure disposition are documented.

## Sensors

The required-sections and upstream-coverage sensors keep validation evidence
reviewable and traceable to the feature summary and acceptance criteria.

## Learn

Maintain timestamped interpretations, deviations, tradeoffs, and open questions
in `<record>/<phase>/<stage>/memory.md`. Do not confuse passing PoC tests with
production readiness.
