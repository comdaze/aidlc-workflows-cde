# PoC Walking Skeleton

MANDATORY: Follow stage-protocol.md for approval gates, question format, and completion messages.

## Steps

### Step 1: Select One Vertical Slice

Load the developer, architecture, and quality personas and the PoC code
organization and robust-portable-code knowledge. Choose the smallest customer-visible path that crosses
the planned application and CDK-managed AWS boundary: one input, one business
decision, one visible outcome. It must be a real runnable slice, not a
mock-only slide deck. The skeleton establishes the project layout: layered
modules (api/service/client/adapter/model), action-oriented file names with no
`utils` dumping ground, and explicit seams between layers so the extension
path can later swap parts without a rewrite.

### Step 2: Implement and Deploy the Slice

Implement the code and infrastructure in the workspace. Use the AWS IaC MCP
server to generate and validate the CDK/CloudFormation definitions (cfn-lint
and compliance checks before deploying), and the AWS knowledge MCP server for
working code examples when a construct is unfamiliar. Add a focused automated
test, run lint/type checks and the test command, deploy through CDK, and prove
the path in the approved non-production environment — confirm the deployed
resources through the AWS API MCP server. Keep sample payloads synthetic or
masked. From the first slice, apply the robust-portable-code rules: wrap every
external call with a safe, specific error message (no ARNs, account IDs, or
stack traces in responses), and take account/region/partition from
`Stack.of(this)` — never hardcode them.

### Step 3: Capture Demo Evidence

Create `poc-accelerator-skeleton-demo.md` with launch command/URL, safe sample
input, expected output, deployment reference, and test result. Start the
workspace README now (purpose, prerequisites, run, teardown for this first
slice — per the documentation guide knowledge); it grows with each expansion
instead of being written in a handoff-day sprint. Create
`poc-accelerator-skeleton-review.md` with what was demonstrated, customer
feedback, and the decision to continue, change direction, or stop.

### Step 4: SA and Customer Demo Gate

Ask only:

- **Approve skeleton** — use the demonstrated path as the base for expansion.
- **Request changes** — revise the slice or solution design before expanding.

### Step 5: Update State

Mark `poc-accelerator-step-04-walking-skeleton` complete in `<record>/aidlc-state.md`.

## Sensors

Linter and type-check sensors validate workspace code. Markdown sensors validate
the demo evidence and its traceability to the design and acceptance criteria.

## Learn

Record timestamped interpretations, deviations, tradeoffs, and open questions
in `<record>/<phase>/<stage>/memory.md`. Record only generalizable lessons and
customer-approved feedback.
