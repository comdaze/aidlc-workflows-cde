# PoC Requirements Capture

MANDATORY: Follow stage-protocol.md for approval gates, question format, and completion messages.

## Steps

### Step 1: Load PoC Context

Load `aidlc-product-agent` and the PoC playbook. Read the confirmed intent,
customer-provided context, and existing project rules. If team knowledge was
imported from another project (an industry pack in the space knowledge
layer), apply the playbook's freshness law before relying on it: entries
older than 6 months without an intervening reference are flagged into this
stage's customer calibration list for re-confirmation, and "judges"-class
entries (safety boundaries, data red lines) are verified first — do not
silently build on stale or unverified imports. Treat customer data as
restricted by default: do not request, copy, or process real production data
unless the customer and the GenAIIC (Generative AI Innovation Center)
co-creation process have explicitly approved it.

### Step 2: Capture a One-Page Delivery Brief

Create `poc-accelerator-requirements-brief.md` with the customer problem,
primary user, narrow business outcome, in-scope flow, explicit exclusions,
3–5-day time box, AWS account/region owner, and assumptions. Keep the brief
small enough to review in one customer session. Before promising a capability,
sanity-check that the candidate AWS services exist in the target region and
partition via the AWS documentation MCP server (or the AWS MCP Remote endpoint
in Global regions, per the regional MCP setup knowledge) — especially for
aws-cn, where service availability differs.

### Step 3: Define Observable Acceptance

Create `poc-accelerator-acceptance-criteria.md` with measurable demo outcomes:
inputs, expected behavior, visible result, test evidence, and the named
customer approver. Separate a PoC success signal from a production requirement.

### Step 4: Capture and Validate Domain Knowledge

Create `poc-accelerator-domain-knowledge-capture.md`. Record the source of each
rule (domain expert, approved document, or customer calibration), unresolved
terms, and any sample-data masking requirement. Write stable customer-specific
rules to the project memory only after the customer confirms them.

### Step 5: Customer Scope Gate

Present the brief and acceptance criteria. Ask only:

- **Approve scope** — lock the PoC boundary and continue to solution design.
- **Request changes** — revise the boundary, success criteria, or data posture.

### Step 6: Update State

Mark `poc-accelerator-step-01-requirements-capture` complete in `<record>/aidlc-state.md`.

## Sensors

The required-sections sensor validates that written Markdown deliverables are
reviewable. The customer approval is the authoritative acceptance of scope.

## Learn

Maintain `<record>/<phase>/<stage>/memory.md` with timestamped interpretations,
deviations, tradeoffs, and open questions. Promote only customer-confirmed,
durable rules; never place customer-sensitive material in framework knowledge.
