// covers: hook:aidlc-session-start
//
// t275 — a COMPLETED workflow must name the path to new work, in every surface
// that speaks to the conductor. Mechanism: cli (spawns the real hook + engine).
//
// THE BUG THIS PINS. A completed intent is a finished record, never a container
// to re-enter, so the only move onward is to birth a NEW intent. That move
// (`next --new-intent` → `intent-birth`) used to appear in no directive, no hook
// message, and no help text, while the session-start hook simultaneously told the
// conductor to offer "the standard resume options (Resume / Redo / Jump / Start
// Fresh)" — a four-option menu defined NOWHERE:
//
//   - "Start Fresh" appeared in exactly one place in the whole authored tree: the
//     hook instructing the conductor to offer it.
//   - "Redo" IS defined elsewhere — as the intra-stage Keep/Modify/Redo gate loop
//     (aidlc-common/protocols/stage-protocol.md) — which is a different thing
//     entirely, so a conductor that went looking found an actively misleading
//     definition rather than none.
//
// Every scope runner (aidlc-runner-gen.ts) forwards freeform text into `next` and
// terminates its loop on `{kind:"done"}`, so the observable failure was: close a
// workflow, type a new request, get told "Workflow complete", and stop. Reported
// live against the `vibe` scope, where "one session per container" is by design
// and so the closed case is the NORMAL one from the second session onward.
//
// WHAT EACH GUARD DOES AND DOES NOT CATCH — stated because a guard whose real
// coverage is unstated gets read as broader than it is:
//   1-2. Behavioural, per surface: the hook's Completed branch and the engine's
//        `done` directive must NAME `--new-intent`. These catch a regression that
//        drops the signpost.
//   3.   Vocabulary: the two dangling menu names must not come back. This is a
//        literal-string guard — it catches the exact regression, not the class.
//   4.   Dangling-reference class guard: every `--flag` the hook's message names
//        must be a flag the engine's parser actually recognises. This catches
//        "the prose names a command that does not exist", which is the general
//        shape of the bug. It would NOT have caught "Start Fresh" (not a flag) —
//        guard 3 owns that case. The pair is honest; neither alone is.
