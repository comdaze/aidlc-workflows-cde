# PoC Feature Expansion

MANDATORY: Follow stage-protocol.md for approval gates, question format, and completion messages.

## Steps

### Step 1: Reconfirm the Approved Boundary

Read the skeleton review and acceptance criteria. Translate customer feedback
into a short ordered implementation list. Defer production hardening, unrelated
features, and unconfirmed industry rules to the extension recommendations.

### Step 2: Implement Core Behavior

Extend the workspace code and TypeScript CDK definitions sequentially, filling
in the layout the skeleton established (per the PoC code organization
knowledge): new behavior goes in small, single-purpose files named for what
they do, store and external-system access stays behind the client/adapter
seams, and nothing accumulates in a `utils` file. A file crossing ~500 lines
is a split signal. Validate CDK/CloudFormation changes through the AWS IaC MCP
server before each deploy, and consult the AWS documentation/knowledge MCP
servers for service behavior instead of guessing API semantics. Keep a trace
from each change to an acceptance criterion; add or update tests alongside the
change. Apply the redaction placeholder to every data-handling path and use
only approved synthetic or masked data.

### Step 3: Verify Locally and in the PoC Environment

Run build, lint, type checks, tests, `cdk synth`, and the safe deployed flow.
Capture any intentional shortfall with its owner and follow-up path rather than
quietly treating it as done.

### Step 4: Write the Reviewable Summary

Create `poc-accelerator-feature-summary.md` (changes, criterion traceability,
tests, and deployment impact) and `poc-accelerator-feature-review.md` (open
risks, exclusions, and review decision).

### Step 5: SA Review Gate

Ask only:

- **Approve implementation** — proceed to test validation.
- **Request changes** — revise the approved core behavior.

### Step 6: Update State

Mark `poc-accelerator-step-05-feature-expansion` complete in `<record>/aidlc-state.md`.

## Sensors

Workspace lint/type-check sensors run on code changes. Markdown sensors ensure
feature evidence cites the skeleton review, requirements, and criteria.

## Learn

Maintain timestamped interpretations, deviations, tradeoffs, and open questions
in `<record>/<phase>/<stage>/memory.md`. Keep unresolved domain rules visible
for the customer rather than assuming them.
